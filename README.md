### Honeeper

A honey-themed creeper variant that wears a bee nest on its head.

**Spawning and creation**
- When a creeper spawns naturally inside a `12*8*12` block area around a bee nest, it spawns as a honeeper instead.
- A naturally spawned honeeper starts with a random honey level: 60% at 0, 25% at 1, 10% at 2, 5% at 3 (full of honey).
- Right-clicking a vanilla creeper while holding an empty bee nest (no bees stored in it) snaps the nest onto its head and converts it into a honeeper.
- Use `/summon creeper_rearranged:honeeper ~ ~ ~ {HoneyLevel:%d}` to summon a honeeper with certain(`%d=0/1/2/3`) honey level.

**Behavior**
- Behaves exactly like a vanilla creeper.
- Pollen-carrying bees are attracted to the nest on its head; when such a bee comes close it loses its pollen and the nest's honey level rises by 1. At honey level 3 the honeeper is full of honey.
- Full-honey explosion: blast damage is halved, hit creatures get Slowness, and every destroyed block has a 30% chance to be replaced with a honey block.

**Harvesting**
- Shears on a full-honey honeeper drop 3 honeycomb; a glass bottle is filled into a honey bottle. Either harvest empties the nest, so bees have to refill it.
- Harvesting does not anger bees.

**Drops**
- Always: an (empty) bee nest and 0-2 gunpowder.
- Full-honey state: 50% chance each for an extra honey block and an extra honeycomb.

**Compatibility**
- With Jade installed, looking at a honeeper shows its honey level (`Honey Level: x/3`, plus "full of honey" at max).
